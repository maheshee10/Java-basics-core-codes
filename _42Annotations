// gives extra information to compiler and runtime
examples of annotation - @overriding
by giving compiler annotation it shows us what could be done
even if we dont give annotation nothing changes in code
but if we give annotation - helpful in debugging logical problesms - which are also clled as bugs
bugs are not compile or runtime issues -- logical errors
mostly annotations - used - in frameworks - like spring
